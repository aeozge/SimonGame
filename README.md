Simon is an electronic game of memory skill. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

This is last project of Advanced Front End Development Projects in Free Code Camp.

I created this project by using HTML,CSS and JavaScript on Sublime Text.

In this project, the game has four colored button which are red,green,yellow and blue. To start the game I should press toggle switch (ON-OFF button) and "start" button. When I hear a sound and see lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, I have to press button/buttons. Each time I input a series of button presses correctly, the counter count how many round I've done,so I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses.
If I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again.
If I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step. 
I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over.
